# QMiner Change Log

### 21 Aug 2015

**non-breaking with new features**

New features:

- k-Means - can reorder computed centroids (clusters) based on a given map
- Nearest Neighbor anomaly detector reimplemented in C++, now much faster. Only works with sparse vectors.

Bug fixes:

- `TZipIn` does not hang when looking for length, on empty files, etc.
- Fixed NaN issue in `TSigmoid`, now works normaly

Other:

- Removed deprecated `TTempIndex` from `qminer_core`
- Merged `qminer_gs` and `qminer_pbs` into `qminer_storage`
- Moved TOAST functions from `qminer_core` to `qminer_storage`
