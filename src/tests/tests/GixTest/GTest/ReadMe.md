# How to set-up GTest (GoogleTest) for C++

All you really need to do is:

1. [Download](http://www.bogotobogo.com/cplusplus/files/cpptest/gtest-1.7.0-rc1.zip) and unpack GTest into directory `qminer\src\tests\tests`
2. The rest should work

Most steps that were taken during development are best described [here](http://www.bogotobogo.com/cplusplus/google_unit_test_gtest.php).
